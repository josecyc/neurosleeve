### The repository includes:
* Source code of two ConvNets that work with spectrograms or the raw data from the four channels
* [Script](data/osc_collect_data.py) to collect data using a Ganglion Board from OpenBCI
* Dataset built from [josecyc](https://github.com/josecyc) and [DanielCordovaV](https://github.com/DanielCordovaV)
* Pre-trained weights for this dataset
* [Demo](demo/stream.py) that maps predictions from model to certain keys
* [Resources](resources) on which we based our project
